    <pre>Overall the paper is well written and provides a novel formalism for
generating a wide range of area plots by combining 1D and 2D primitive
plots. Importantly, it ties this plot generation method to the
decomposition of high-dimensional pdfs to lower dimensional marginal and
conditional distributions. The organization and presentation is well done
and will likely encourage more rigorous thinking about plot semantics in
infovis.

The biggest weakness of the paper is that it's not clear that the
proposed formalism leads to any useful new visualizations. Despite this,
I believe that the paper provides a useful contribution to the infovis
literature.

  <h2>The Review  </h2></td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td valign=top>
    <pre>This paper presents a formalism for recursively constructing area plots
out of 1D and 2D plot primitives. I think there are two criteria by which
one should evaluate this formalism. First, does it lead to more insight
into current practices? The answer to this is a definite yes. The authors
successfully show that a wide range of existing plot types can be
described as resulting from the composition of the area-based primitives.
More importantly, the authors demonstrate that there is a correspondence
between plot composition from graphical primitives and distribution
composition from conditional and marginal distributions. This should help
infovis researchers to better understand how existing plots should be
used and what analytic questions they can best answer. I believe it could
also lead to interesting new interfaces which allow the user to directly
specify the statistical question they want answered and which then
automatically create an appropriate distribution and then an appropriate
plot.

The second evaluation criteria is does the formalism lead to new useful
visualization types? On this score the paper is less successful. The
authors do provide a few examples of novel plot types, but make no effort
to demonstrate that they are better than existing ones. Indeed, at first
glance they appear rather difficult to read. The authors also suggest
that the area decomposition method might be useful for handling higher
dimensional data sets, but given the difficulty in reading some of their
3d plots, I think some skepticism is warranted. Further, as the authors
point out, the combination of 4 primitives and the alternative
decomposition methods for high dimensional distributions leads to a very
large number of possible plots. It seems likely that many combinations of
primitives will be exceedingly difficult to read. So the proposed
formalism is not parsimonious; a better formalism would exclude
ineffective plots.

Finally, I wonder if the authors considered any other graphical
composition method than nesting areas? While nesting areas allowed them
to encompass a number of existing plot types, other composition methods
might be more useful for extension to higher dimensions. For example,
what about simply showing a separate plot for each component?

Despite the shortcomings of the paper on the second criteria and my
skepticism about area-nesting, I think the paper provides an important
contribution on the first criteria and will lead to new research
directions and, thus, should be accepted. Since I believe that the
connection between plot types and distribution decompositions is the
major contribution of the paper, I recommend that the authors:

-label all appropriate plots in the paper with the corresponding
distribution decomposition (directly label, not just mention in the text
or in the caption)
-flesh out section 3.1. Assuming that infovis readers will not know what
conditional and marginal distributions are, the authors should
demonstrate how they are computed from the joint distribution. Providing
the graphical analogs to the tables in Figure 4 would be extremely
helpful. (I realize that a marginal and a conditional distribution from
Figure 4 are represented in Figure 5, but the connection is never made
explicitly in the text. Some hand holding would be very helpful here.)
Hand hold better the analytic questions that each distribution helps
answer. E.g. "What proportion of males are very happy? The bottom left
entries tells us it's 31%."


Minor comments----

Why squarified treemaps? Heer work showing non-square treemaps are easier
to read.

Section 3.1 

Its not clear from the wording in the first paragraph that the marginal
and conditional distributions contain less information than the joint
distribution. If you're going to assume that your readers don't know what
the marginal and conditional distributions are (plausible for the InfoVis
crowd), then it would make sense to briefly describe how they are
computed from the joint distribution.

Fix the formatting of the tables in Figure 4.

Clarify in the last paragraph that in addition to the 3 factorings,
permutations of the variables leads to more variations.

"It remains to find an [sic] graphical analog of this multiplication."
seems unnecessarily dramatic. We already know you found one.

Section 3.2 

Label Figure 5 with the distribution forms, f(happy), f(happy|sex),
f(happy, sex), rather than just mention them in the text.

Figure 7 shows, f(marital | age) f(age) and f(age | marital) f(marital),
right? Say this in the text and label figures.

"the relationship between proportion and area is only constant within a
level" -- is there a better way to say this? I think you mean level as in
nesting level, not level as is a level of a factor, right? In Figure 7
(right), the nested bar charts are all sized proportionally with respect
to each other even though they occur in different levels of the marital
status factor.

Figure 8 middle would be better with a bar chart, right? Why show both
the middle and right plots; they're basically the same.

Section 6.2

Why limit yourself to a finite number of bins? Push the number of bins to
infinity and you can display line graphs (density plots) with hbar,
stacked line graphs (hbar+vspine), relative area (hspine+vspine),
overlaid line charts (hbar+hbar), or (hspine+hbar) (don't know the name
of this chart, basically overlaid line charts, but where the sum of
values at each vertical slice is 1).
