Product Plots

This paper introduces a framework for understanding a broad class of
categorical visualizations. The framework generalizes some specialized
plots familiar to these two researchers (especially mosaic plots) and
should simplify the development of software for these types of
visualizations in the future. 

A surprising omission is the work of Wilkinson (1999, 2005) on The
Grammar of Graphics. Wilkinson introduced the idea of combining graphical
elements through products of sets (called facets) and embedding these in
different coordinate systems. In fact, Figure 12 echoes several of the
figures in the Coordinates chapter of that book. Wilkinson was also the
first to draw a link between the recursive partitioning in treemaps and
mosaics and a set product operator. As he explains in Chapter 16 of the
second edition, the algebra for specifying visualizations of product
models maps one-to-one to the most common factorial experimental design
algebra for log-linear models or ANOVA. In any case, the framework in
this paper appears closer to that of Wilkinson's than to any of the other
papers cited.

Minor points:
Page 1. "This framework is based on the fundamental statistical idea that
high any high dimensional" Delete the first "high."

"51 020 and 5 000" use comma delimiters.

Bottom of page:
Using the word "all" is a bit strong here. Better to delete the word and
confine the discussion to "area" plots. There are exceptions, as the
authors point out later, so avoid the inclusive term.

The claim for rectangles at the bottom of page 1 is not supported by
research. The authors, like many statisticians and visualization
researchers, tend to cite statisticians and computer scientists for
supportive psychological principles; however, the perceptual and
cognitive research by non-psychologists tends to have serious
methodological flaws. I've provided some relevant citations below. There
are significant biases in area judgments that are exacerbated by extreme
aspect ratios (something even Kong, Heer & Agrawala noticed in Treemaps).
The perceptual combining rule for rectangles appears to be more Attneave
(absolute metric) than product (multiplicative), although see Algom et
al. for support for the multiplicative rule. The authors need to rephrase
this statement, eliminating the word "must."

Also, Simken and Hastie, in one of the few perception articles published
by psychologists in a statistical journal, demonstrated conclusively that
pie charts outperform rectangular area charts for proportion of whole
data. There are some exceptions to their findings, but statisticians need
to understand that they are largely wrong in their scorn for pie charts.

We can tile triangles with triangles. And these are "simpler" than
rectangles. One can also tile the sphere with triangles, which cannot be
done with rectangles. You need to rethink this assertion. 

Figure 12. The bottom row is not produced by transforming after rotation.
It is produced by switching the assignment of x and y to r and theta.
This is a pivoting operation.

Page 2.
"Uniformly distributed" suggest to me a uniform random distribution. Is
there another way to say this?

Figure 3. Left and Right are Top and Bottom. LaTeX refused to obey your
orders, as usual ;o)

Please italicize n in the fourth line of Section 3. Check that other
parameters are properly italicized in the text.

Table 1 and text.
I was brought up to call it Gender rather than Sex. I think the GSS
(thanks to Ed Laumann) is obsessed with sex, so we'll let it go.
