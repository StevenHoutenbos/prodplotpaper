  <tr><td></td><td valign=top>
    <pre>This paper shows how a small set of partition operators and simple
graphical primitives can be used to construct a wide variety of
rectangular plots that use area to encode frequency (count) data.
Continuous distributions are supported via binning.

Though not completely novel, the presented model contributes to our array
of methods for characterizing and generating visualizations. It may also
have the potential to further spur needed research along these lines.</pre>

  <h2>The Review  </h2></td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td valign=top>
    <pre>The presented formalism is clean, compact and can be used to generate a
wide variety of plots. The simplicity and expressiveness of the model is
attractive; the authors demonstrate how it can be used to generate a
range of plots on a sample database.

However, the model is presented in a rather self-contained manner. Sure,
the model can generate a large number of plots, but how many of those
plots are actually useful? Is it difficult for analysts to choose the
"right" plots? How might graphical perception guidelines or other
heuristics be used to help search and prune the space? I would have liked
to see the authors close the loop on their discussed interactive
navigation methods.

The paper is concise, which is great. However, this also means there is
plenty of space to add additional needed detail:

First, related work is distributed throughout the paper. A consolidated
related work section addressing similar work and clearly delineating the
contributions of the present work is needed. Other visualization models
of interest include Slingsby et al's HiVE, Wilkinson's Grammar of
Graphics, Mackinlay's APT, and Stolte et al's Polaris. A detailed
comparison with such prior work is a pre-requisite to publication. How do
such models compare in terms of expressiveness and notational efficiency?
(My score of 4 is contingent on the assumption that such a section will
be added...)

Second, I'm curious how much effort is necessary to use product plots in
practice. Some examples of statements in R and the corresponding plots
should suffice (and potentially examples of an interactive UI for product
plot construction).

Third, is anyone using the system to perform analyses? While not strictly
necessary, example analysis case studies supported by product plots might
help convey the value of the model.

MISCELLANEA

There is a line break after "Abstract-". The abstract text should begin
on the same line.

"the areas of rectangles are easier to compare than areas of other shapes
[5-7]" -> This is somewhat glibly stated. A quick review of the cited
papers does not support the claim: [5] does not assess area empirically;
[6] assesses circular and arbitrary polygonal areas, but not rectangles;
[7] compares circles and rectangles, but the difference does not appear
to be statistically significant. Later in the paper, there is a similar
critique of non-rectangular polygons using the results of [6]. I don't
think this is appropriate -- [6] uses irregular polygons, whereas
techniques like voronoi treemaps generate convex polygons with average
bounding box aspect ratios near unity. Thus the argument here is also
unsubstantiated. It may well be that rectangles are better, but this has
not been convincingly demonstrated. I recommend the authors consider
dropping these perceptual arguments.

Figure 4 overruns its column.</pre>

  <h2>The Summary Review  </h2></td></tr>
  <tr><td></td><td valign=top>
    <pre>The reviewers judge Product Plots to be a useful and parsimonious model
for constructing a large variety of plots and potentially also an example
that might spur further research in formal models of visualization
construction. All reviewers agree that this work makes a substantive
contribution to InfoVis research and argue for acceptance.

That said, reviewers also raise a number of issues that the authors
should address prior to publication. Most notable among these is the
treatment of related work. R1 and R4 in particular list elements of prior
work that should be considered and discussed. I recommend that the
authors introduce a dedicated related work section in their next
revision.

In addition, the reviewers make a number of helpful suggestions that
might inform future drafts. I strongly encourage the authors to revise
the paper accordingly.</pre>
